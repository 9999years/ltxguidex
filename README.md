# The `ltxguidex` document class

The ltxguidex document class extends ltxguide with a set of environments and
commands that make writing beautiful LaTeX documentation easier and more
natural. Currently, many packages define their own extensions to documentation
support inline with their packages, leaving everyone to copy/paste their own
contributions.

This release of ltxguidex is an experimental public beta; it intends to
demonstrate a hopeful new direction without committing to a stable public API.

Although ltxguidex is now suitable for use in your own documentation, do not be
surprised if future versions break your docs.
